A script to scrape the contents of http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html into a database, and a search app with autocomplete, that searches them and returns links to the original website.

For development, run the scraper separately to create the database, by running "node scraper.js" once. This overwrites the database, if it already exists. Then, run "npm install" and start the dev script.
